# Django ORM

1. to start up a local first thing we need to do `pipenv install` to create virtual environment and install all the app
2. active virtual env , `pipenv shell`
3. check sql connection config, create database in mysql
4. run migration

### Query_set

1. Query_set encalsulate the query, it will only execute when
   - we iterate it
   - when we convert it into list(query_set)
   - when we slice it, or access specific element
2. The reason for doing this, is because we can use queryset to build complex queries, to save the memories
   ```
   query_set = Product.objects.all()
   query_set.filter().filter().order_by()
   ```
3. There are some method we will directly get the query. For example `count = Product.objects.count()` return number
